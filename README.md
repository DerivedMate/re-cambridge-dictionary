# Cambridge dictionary scraper
A portable dictionary, built with multi-definition display.
The multi-definition display was actually the (main) reason I've built this project, as I could no longer put up with switching from site to site in search for definitions.
The other reason was my recently gained knowledge of ReasonML - functional language created by facebook targeting both js and ocaml as it's compilation targets.

## Disclaimer 
As you'll most likely notice, the website initially takes a few seconds to load. This is caused not by server architecture, but by the free hosting namely Heroku, which shuts down servers when they're not in use.
